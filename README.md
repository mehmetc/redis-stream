s2.on_message do |message|
  m = message['payload']
  puts "Hello #{m}"
  s1.stop
  s2.stop
end

s1.start(false)
s2.start(false)

id = s1.add("World!", "to" => "*", "group" => "MANIFEST", "type" => Redis::Stream::Type::ACTION)

Timeout::timeout(10) do
  loop do
    break unless s1.running? || s2.running?
    sleep 1
    puts "checkin if still active #{s1.running?}, #{s2.running?}"
